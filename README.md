## Configuration

The default timeout is 60 seconds ( I highly suggest it). In my experience, 5 seconds works better â€” it's faster but in the long run will hit Discord's rate limits ( I ran 5s cooldown for about 2 hours before being disabled for suspicious activities). Feel free to change it, but tweak carefully depending on what you're doing.

> [!TIP]
> https://nelly.tools/tags is a great place to find servers with clan tags.
