## Configuration

The default timeout is 60 seconds. In my experience, 5 seconds works better â€” it's faster and less likely to hit Discord's rate limits. Feel free to change it, but tweak carefully depending on what you're doing.

In `index.ts`, make sure to load your Discord Clan Tag Server IDs:

```ts
var guilds: Array<any> = [];
```
> [!TIP]
> https://nelly.tools/tags is a great place to find servers with clan tags.

## Installation
